		<h1>The Build Process</h1>
		<h2>Brief</h2>
		<p>
			To create a highly vsual site on all devices - rethinking the stacked nature of mobile content - to find a means of seamlessly integrating web, table and mobile experiences.
		</p>
		<h2>Approach</h2>
		<p>
			With such a simple set of requirements, we placed importance on having the site as lightweight and easily editable as possible.  Static site generators, a way of serving files without the need for a CMS or database, seemed to compliment the brief as a secure and performant solution.
		</p>

		<h2>Technology</h2>
		<p>
			The intrinsically portable nature of static sites meant we also had a wide choice over where we wanted to host the site, allowing us to take advantage of the free hosting service Heroku.
		</p>

		<p>
			We decided to use the static site generator Jekyll partly because it was the first we came across, but mostly due to its level of popularity.

			We need to make mobile a core part of the end product - not an add-on feature.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Despite being written in Ruby, understanding the language is not required in order to develop a simple site. That said, sinking our teeth into the Jekyll plugin was necessary in order to add a Liquid template plugin (http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) for padding the project numbers, e.g. so 5 becomes ‘005’.

		<h2>Deployment</h2>
		<p>
			Of course our next question was, how can we make the process of adding new content, deploying a new Jekyll build and serving the updated content as seamless and streamlined as possible?
		</p>
		<p>
			Our answer to this was to have GitHub act as our CMS whilst a service called Travis listens for commits and automatically runs a deploy script to copy and serve the files on the third party hosting service; Heroku.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using GitHub as a means of managing the content not only allows us to maintain revisions of the code which can be reverted back to, but also - acts as a simple environment with the only dependency being that the client has a web browser.
			Whilst the site could just have been easily hosted on GitHub Pages, we wanted the flexibility of including additional Ruby middleware features such as script minification and asset compression.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout the build, much consideration was taken to ensure that the mobile experience felt a core part of the end-product and not an add-on. This meant taking time to experiment with web fonts, scalable backgrounds and vectored glyphs as icons to ensure a crisper look on high resolution screens and an equal experience across all platforms.
